      <h2>Origins: Digital Mars</h2>
      <p>
        D has its origins in Digital Mars.
        Thus the 'Mars' theme has always been closely tied to it.

      <h2>Devil</h2>
      <p>
        A couple of logos have associated D with the devil.
        The reason is unclear (perhaps just 'D' for devil?).
